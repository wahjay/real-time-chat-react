# react-real-time-chat

<b>Description</b>: A React real-time chat where users can chat anoymously in a public room.
And uses can also chat privately with others.

URL to the app: <a href="https://quantumchat.netlify.app" title="Quantum Chat">Link to the chat app</a>


Based on the tutorial from <b>JavaScript Mastery</b>, Adrian Hajdin.
On top of that, I have extended the chat-app by adding some features such as private messages, and unread messages notification, adding friends.


### Features to be added later

* allow users to send images/videos
* add a mini feed
